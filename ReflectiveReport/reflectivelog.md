## This log consists of my activity in the selection of two articles related to LSRE methods or techniques and their implementation.

## Week 48

For selecting two articles i searched for different methods and techniques in Large scale requirements engineering in Inspec database and several articles came out. Search string like this used for searching articles ((((techniques OR methods) WN KY) AND ((requirements engineering) WN KY)) AND ((large scale) WN KY)) then the articles abstract are studied and no interesting articles found this way. <br>

Then the given articles for homework are interested than the articles which i searched. So the two articles are selected as they are stuides for MDRE process assignment. The selected articles are "Requirements abstraction model" by Gorschek, Tony, and Claes Wohlin and "An industrial survey of requirements interdependencies in software product release planning" by Carlshamre, PÃ¤r, et al. These are chosen because these support large scale requirements and the techniques will reduce the complexity of the requirement task. <br>

## Technique OR Method
The technique/method that will be tested are: <br>
I. RAM model <br>
II. Interdependency between requirements technique. <br>

## Week 50

### Implementation
I. The selected model is implemented by using course mnagement system requirements. These requirements are taken from the release planning assignment and the requirements are implemented by following the guide of RAM model. As first the requirements need to be placed in the suitable level given in the model and then breakdown or workup of the requirements need to be done. This detailed implementation will be provided in reflective report. <br>

## Week 51

### Implementation

As the above RAM model is implemented above but the result of RAM model is not used here as the article did not mentioned that for priotization it should be in abstract levels, so this technique is implemented seperately from above. As course management system requirements are taken because there is some experience with these as we worked for RP assignment. Also tried for ticket booking system requirements but there are less number of requirements so not implemented using these. <br>

II. The selected technique is implemented by using course management system requirements. The implementation is followed by priortizing the requirements without considering the dependency as given in article. Then the top 20 requirements are taken and the pair wise assessment is done on these requirements. The interdependency between requirements are noted in the excel sheet and the detailed explanation will be given in reflective report. <br>

## Week 1 (2016)

The results from the implementation are compared with the results from the article and what other articles mentioned. As per implementation, a detailed reflective report is prepared.<br>
