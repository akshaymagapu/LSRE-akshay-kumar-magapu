 ## Summary

1. Complexity increases while handling the requirements in very-large scale requirements engineering. The authors identified the key research opportunities in this domain. Based on the size of requirements there are four orders of magnitude: In small-scale requirements engineering the order of magnitude is approximately 10 requirements, in medium-scale requirements engineering the order of magnitude is approximately 100 requirements, In large-scale requirements engineering the order of magnitude is approximately 1000 requirements and In very large-scale requirements engineering the order of magnitude is approximately 10,000 requirements. So the complexity level is described based on the number of requirements because these includes the number of customers, end-users, developers, product features. Also, complexity depends upon the dependencies between the requirements as in large scale and very large scale requirements engineering the dependencies between requirements are high compared to small and medium-scale requirements engineering. In this paper a case study is done at Sony ericsson which had a transition from Large-scale requirements engineering to very large-scale requirements engineering. As there are many stakeholder internal and external categories, market driven requirements which are originated from external stakeholder are generated by many operators with thousands of requirements. So the total number of requirements exceeded more than ten thousand. So to decrease the complexity level of the requirements, the requirements are bundled into features with small units and written in natural language with set of properties so to easily allocate in requirement management tool. Based on the case study the authors bring forward three key research opportunities.
   Sustainable requirements architecture: fighting information overload
   How to manage the information overload while developing and execution of previous requirements?
    Effective requirements abstraction: fighting combinatorial explosion
   How to effectively abstract the requirements and combinations of requirements.
    emergent quality prediction: fighting over-scoping.
   How to deal with dependences among quality requirements and how to predict the effort for large scope of system.
   By knowing the solutions to these problems, managing the complexity of the requirements and predicting system quality aspects can be done.
   
2. the main goal of the paper is to find the challenges while aligning the requirement engineering and verification process as coordination between the requirement and verification process is significant to assure the customer satisfaction. So to know the challenges authors conducted a interview based research in large software development company. Also based on pre-understanding to the authors, designed a conceptual model which consists of three dimensions and used as a guide while conducting interviews.
    i. Abstract level dimension: It consists of test artefacts which can be used to verify code and also requirements.
    ii. Time dimension: Changes in process, product and project as per time.
    iii. Dimension of product lines: It address the variability while developing product in product line engineering approach.
 Based on interviews, the identified challenges faced by the company are:
    Organization and process issues in which communication problems, documentation standard problems, who is responsible for the decision problem and also many organisation units involve so lot of confusion arises.
    People issues in which there is lack of understanding each individual work in company, lack of communication and cooperation.
    Tools issues in which lack of adequate software tools to categorize requirements which is most important challenge.
    Requirement process issues in which there is lack of update in requirements as soon as change occurs, defining and managing of quality requirements.
    Testing issues in which lack of well-defined testing process, cooperation between testers and analysts.
    Change management issues in which there is lack of update in requirements, tracking and reporting of changes.
    Traceability issues in which there are large volume and complex requirements, test cases.
    Measurement issues in which there is difficulty to define the metrics to measure the coverage of requirements.
    So these finding helps practitioners to investigate alignment in their organization and researchers to make effective management of alignment between requirements and verification process.
3. This paper discuss the challenges faced in large scale requirements and lessons learned while addressing these challenges in a large scale project.  The necessity of requirements is more when the developing system is more complex. Also high quality requirements are important to plan, implement and test. In industries the problems faced are never documented so same mistakes repeat, in order to overcome this the authors, collect the lessons learned while addressing the challenges.  In the selected project there are more than four thousand user requirements in which the challenges faced are: 
Large number of customer requirements: the number of requirements given by customer are large so it is a challenge while analysing. 
Formal interface to customer: Communication between analyst and customer is formal so that feedback takes time which is challenge.
Management of customer expectation: As system is large, early increments are shown to customer which must satisfy customer which is a challenge.
 Changing technology: technology changes had to be considered while development.
 Distributed teams: Globalization in software development is a major challenge to coordinate between teams.
 Traceability: Creating and maintaining traces of requirement is a complex task and takes more manual effort
 Scope change and creep: Scope change as the customer requires modification is a major challenge.   
 Resource fluctuation: As the team may turnover so the knowledge need to be easily transferred to new members which is a challenge.
   Based on the above challenges, the lessons learned are:
   i. Developing a well-structured feature set
   ii. Obtain a good understanding of customer requirements.
   iii. Use specification approach that scale.
   iv. Separate requirement and design decisions.
   v. Establish a traceability model
   vi. Define a traceability measurement process.
   vii. Provide project status visualization.
   viii. Establish effective documentation standard.
   So as per authors experience, these lessons contribute to project success.
	
## Answers

1. The number of requirements and interdependencies exceeds 1000 and managing a interdependencies set is impractical, but suitable by forming requirements into a small bundle[1] in large-scale requirements engineering. Selecting, managing, assigning, controlling, changing the requirements in large scale industry relates to large-scale requirements engineering.

2. The challenges faced in large-scale requirements engineering are [2] [3]:

    People issues:
   
    i. More number of requirements from customer.
    
    ii. Understanding of each other's work in a company.
    
    iii. Communication and cooperation between organization units.
    
    iv. Global distribution teams is also a challenge.
    
    Traceability issues:
    
    i. Complex requirements in a large volume.
    
    ii. More number of test cases as per requirements.
    
    Tools issues:
    
    i. There are less user-friendly tools.
    
    ii. lack of adequate tools.
    
    Change management issues:
    
    i. Whenever a requirements are changed or new requirements are added these needs to be updated.
    
    ii.technology changes need to be considered.
    
    iii. Scope change is also a challenge.
    
    
3. The order of magnitude of the number of requirements in large-scale requirements engineering are more than 1000 requirements, where as in very large-scale requirements engineering it exceeds 10,000 requirements [1].

     ## Summary
     
     In this paper, to improve the release planning process the authors tried to integrate two approaches. In one approach communication, knowledge of human, and negotiation of conflicts are included which is art of release planning. In another approach a solution is generated by applying a formalized problem to computational algorithm which is sciene of release planning.
     Basically, organizations does not use a sound model or methodology they just select requirements and assign in release planning in a informal way. so there is no exact information about how to perform release planning process effectively.
     Agile methodology also takes this art approach to involve humanistic characteristic but it does not provide how to select features when multiple stakeholder exist. the optimization model authors presented here is by having flexibility in number of releases in which a decision variables consists of set of features and goal is to assign these set of features to some release options.
     Coupling relation exist between features in which two features need to be released combined and a precedence relation in which a sequence of releases to be done.
     Each release plan should satisy the resources available. Stakeholders are priortized by using a ordinal scale(1-9). Features are also priortized by using ordinal scale(1-9) and urgency of feature whther to release first or later release.
     Finally, an objective function is assumed in which average of stakeholders, feature priortization is done to maximize function in every release plan and satisfy resource constraint which comes undermodelling phase.
     so based on these, a set of good alternatives can be achieved by solving the linear programming problem in which a good solution is considered only if it is 95% of object function value which is exploration phase.
     So a human expert evaluates the alternatives and selects a best one which is a consolidation phase.
     As by integrating these two approaches, best features like formalization of problem, sophisticated method, human intuition, and evaluation of alternative solution leads to improvement in release planning process.
