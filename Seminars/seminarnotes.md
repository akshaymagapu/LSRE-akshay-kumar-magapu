## Summary

[1]. Complexity increases while handling the requirements in very-large scale requirements engineering. The authors identified the key research opportunities in this domain. Based on the size of requirements there are four orders of magnitude: In small-scale requirements engineering the order of magnitude is more than 10 requirements, in medium-scale requirements engineering the order of magnitude is more than 100 requirements, In large-scale requirements engineering the order of magnitude is more than 1000 requirements and In very large-scale requirements engineering the order of magnitude is more than 10,000 requirements. So the complexity level is described based on the number of requirements because these includes the number of customers, end-users, developers, product features. Also, complexity depends upon the dependencies between the requirements as in large scale and very large scale requirements engineering the dependencies between requirements are high compared to small and medium-scale requirements engineering. In this paper a case study is done at Sony ericsson which had a transition from Large-scale requirements engineering to very large-scale requirements engineering. As there are many stakeholders in internal and external categories, market driven requirements which are originated from external stakeholder are generated by many operators with thousands of requirements such that total number of requirements exceeded more than ten thousand. So to decrease the complexity level of the requirements, the requirements are bundled into features with small units and written in natural language with set of properties so to easily allocate in requirement management tool. Based on the case study the authors bring forward three key research opportunities.
   
  Sustainable requirements architecture: fighting information overload
  How to manage the information overload while developing and execution of previous requirements?
   
  Effective requirements abstraction: fighting combinatorial explosion
  How to effectively abstract the requirements and combinations of requirements.
   
  Emergent quality prediction: fighting over-scoping.
  How to deal with dependences among quality requirements and how to predict the effort for large scope of system.
   
  By knowing the solutions to these problems, managing the complexity of the requirements and predicting system quality aspects can become easy.
   
[2]. The main goal of the paper is to find the challenges while aligning the requirement engineering and verification process, as coordination between the requirement and verification process is significant to assure the customer satisfaction. So to know the challenges authors conducted a interview based research in large software development company. Also based on pre-understanding to the authors, designed a conceptual model which consists of three dimensions and used as a guide while conducting interviews.
  
  i. Abstract level dimension: It consists of test artefacts which can be used to verify code and also requirements.
 ii. Time dimension: Changes in process, product and project as per time.
 iii. Dimension of product lines: It address the variability while developing product in product line engineering approach.
   
 Based on interviews, the identified challenges faced by the company are:
 Organization and process issues in which communication problems, documentation standard problems, who is responsible for the decision problem and also many organisation units involvement leads to lot of confusion.
 People issues in which there is lack of understanding each individual work in company, lack of communication and cooperation.
 Tools issues in which lack of adequate software tools to categorize requirements which is most important challenge.
 Requirement process issues in which there is lack of update in requirements as soon as change occurs, defining and managing of quality requirements.
 Testing issues in which lack of well-defined testing process, cooperation between testers and analysts.
 Change management issues in which there is lack of update in requirements, tracking and reporting of changes.
 Traceability issues in which there are large volume and complex requirements, test cases.
  Measurement issues in which there is difficulty to define the metrics to measure the coverage of requirements.
  So these finding helps practitioners to investigate alignment in their organization and researchers to make effective approaches to manage the alignment between requirements and verification process.
  
[3]. This paper discuss the challenges faced in large scale requirements and lessons learned while addressing these challenges in a large scale project.  The necessity of requirements is more when the developing system is more complex. Also high quality requirements are important to plan, implement and test the product. In industries the problems faced are never documented so same mistakes repeat, in order to overcome this, authors collected the lessons learned while addressing the challenges.  In the selected project there are more than four thousand user requirements in which the challenges faced are: 
  
   Large number of customer requirements: the number of requirements given by customer are large so it is a challenge while analysing. 
   
   Formal interface to customer: Communication between analyst and customer is formal so that feedback takes time which is challenge.
   
   Management of customer expectation: As system is large, early increments are shown to customer which must satisfy customer which is a challenge.
   
   Changing technology: technology changes had to be considered while development.
   
   Distributed teams: Globalization in software development is a major challenge to coordinate between teams.
   
   Traceability: Creating and maintaining traces of requirement is a complex task and takes more manual effort.
   
   Scope change and creep: Scope change as the customer requires modification is a major challenge.   
   
   Resource fluctuation: As the team may turnover so the knowledge need to be easily transferred to new members which is a challenge.
   
   Based on the above challenges, the lessons learned are:
   
   i. Developing a well-structured feature set
   ii. Obtain a good understanding of customer requirements.
   iii. Use specification approach that scale.
   iv. Separate requirement and design decisions.
   v. Establish a traceability model
   vi. Define a traceability measurement process.
   vii. Provide project status visualization.
   viii. Establish effective documentation standard.
   So as per authors experience, these lessons contribute to project success.
	
## Answers

1. The number of requirements and interdependencies exceeds 1000 and managing an interdependencies set is impractical, but suitable by forming requirements into a small bundle units [1] in large-scale requirements engineering. Selecting, managing, assigning, controlling, changing the requirements in large scale industry relates to large-scale requirements engineering.

2. The challenges faced in large-scale requirements engineering are [2] [3]:

    People issues:
   
    i. More number of requirements from customer.
    
    ii. Understanding of each other's work in a company.
    
    iii. Communication and cooperation between organization units.
    
    iv. Global distribution teams is also a challenge.
    
    Traceability issues:
    
    i. Complex requirements in a large volume.
    
    ii. More number of test cases as per requirements.
    
    Tools issues:
    
    i. There are less user-friendly tools.
    
    ii. lack of adequate tools.
    
    Change management issues:
    
    i. Whenever requirements are changed or new requirements are added these needs to be updated.
    
    ii.technology changes need to be considered.
    
    iii. Scope change is also a challenge.
    
    
3. The order of magnitude of the number of requirements in large-scale requirements engineering are more than 1000 requirements, where as in very large-scale requirements engineering it exceeds 10,000 requirements [1].

   i. Ruhe “The art and science of release planning”, plus some more recent works on the EVOLVE methods.

   Summary
     
   In this paper, to improve the release planning process the authors tried to integrate two approaches. In one approach communication, knowledge of human, and negotiation of conflicts are included which is art of release planning. In another approach a solution is generated by applying a formalized problem to computational algorithm which is science of release planning.
   Basically, organizations do not use a sound model or methodology they just select requirements and assign in release planning in a informal way. So there is no exact information about how to perform release planning process effectively.
   Agile methodology also takes this art approach to involve humanistic characteristic but it does not provide how to select features when multiple stakeholder exists. The optimization model authors presented here has the flexibility in number of releases in which, a decision variable consists of set of features and the goal is to assign these set of features to some release options.
   Coupling relation exist between features in which two features need to be released combined and a precedence relation in which a sequence of releases to be done.
   Each release plan should satisfy the resources available. Stakeholders are prioritized by using a ordinal scale (1-9). Features are also prioritized by using ordinal scale (1-9) and urgency of feature whether to release first or later release.
   Finally, an objective function is assumed in which average of stakeholders, feature prioritization is used to maximize function in every release plan and satisfy resource constraint which comes under modelling phase.
   So based on these, a set of good alternatives can be achieved by solving the linear programming problem in which a good solution is considered only if it is 95% of object function value which is exploration phase.
   A human expert evaluates the alternatives and selects a best one which is a consolidation phase.
   As by integrating these two approaches, best features like formalization of problem, sophisticated method, human intuition, and evaluation of alternative solution leads to improvement in release planning process.
     
   ii. R: Berntsson Svensson, B. Regnell (2015) “A case study evaluation of the guideline-supported QUPER model for elicitation of quality requirements”, 21st International Working Conference on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ’15), Essen, Germany, pp. 230-246, 2015. 
 
   Summary
   
   In this paper, the authors described how to use The Quality Performance Model (QUPER) with some practical guidelines which is a complete version of QUPER and also cost dependencies incorporated with quality in this model. Then authors evaluated the model after applying above two techniques in the company. The main intention behind developing QUPER model is there is a lack of appropriate model which defines the quality requirements for release planning process. The reason for incorporating the cost dependency is it will have a major impact on the estimated cost for other quality requirements and lead to change in cost barriers of other quality requirements and also in selecting quality requirements for release planning process. The practical guidelines are as follows:
   i.	Identify Candidate QR:  Competitors, market segments, relevant capabilities are need to be considered while defining quality requirements.
   ii.	Define scale and unit: To measure the level of quality a scale and measurement unit is to be defined.
   iii.	Identify reference levels: Reference levels of actual and competitor products need to be identified so that it provides objective measure which can be related to quality requirements.
   iv.	Elicit quality breakpoints: Market expectations are to be defined by using three types of breakpoints which are utility, saturation, differentiation breakpoints.
   v.	Estimate cost barriers: Two cost barriers are need to be estimated, one is for software changes and another one is for hardware components or software architecture.
   vi.	Set candidate requirements: In this step make estimations and actual requirements need to be decided. A quality interval also need to be specified by using good and stretch.
   vii.	Identify cost dependencies: Identify cost dependencies between two or more quality requirements sets and list which are easy and cheaper to do if QR is improved and list which are difficult and expensive even if QR is improved. Based on this a human expert select a QR which will be implemented with best level of quality.

   To evaluate the complete version of QUPER model, two evaluations are done based on interviews and questionnaires. The guidelines are provided to implement this QUPER model.  So by analysing the results from the interviews and questionnaires the lessons learned are:
•	Ease of use: QUPER model is easy to use and many practitioners explained that guidelines are very easy to apply and some practitioners think that all steps are not really necessary.
•	Importance of the views: Roadmap view is considered most important as it visualizes both cost and benefit view. Benefit view is moderately important and cost view is least important as it takes lot of work for estimating the costs.
•	Applicability of cost dependency step: Many think that provided guidelines for cost dependency are easy to apply as it is similar to their previous approaches.
•	Supporting release planning: All agree that QUPER improves the understanding of QR early. Roadmap view is considered most important in QUPER model by practitioners. Also many of them believed that this model improves the communication between staff and customers and can know the position of the product in the competitive market. Some think that QUPER model cannot be used in the middle of development, it should be used from beginning to launch of the product in the market.
   So QUPER model is easy to apply with given guidelines but the cost dependency is not suitable for different domains apart from the evaluated domain. So future work includes evaluating the QUPER model in different domains.

   
 iii. Berntsson Svensson & Olsson “Introducing support for release planning of quality requirements –an industrial evaluation of the QUPER model”  
   
  Summary
    
  Requirements are prioritized by using cost and value dimensions. In this paper, the authors added another dimension Quality and developed a quality performance model (QUPER). Also implemented and revaluated this model in large-scale industry which is Sony ericsson and mainly focused how QUPER model can be used in a company.
  QUPER was developed in three steps:
  i. Understanding different requirement decision scenarios which comes under problem definition.
  ii. By including three view models comes under model definition.
  iii. Evaluating the model with experts comes under model validation.
  Goals for QUPER are: robust to uncertainty, easy to use, domain relevant.
  In model definition there are three views which are benefit view, cost view, roadmap view.
  Benefit view consists of three breakpoints:
  Utility breakpoint in which there is a border between quality level useless and useful quality.
  Differentiation breakpoint in which it represents the shift from useful to competitive quality.
  Saturation breakpoint in which change in quality level from competitive to excessive quality.
  Cost view represents non-linear relation between cost and quality.
  Roadmap view visualizes the quality of our product with quality of competitive product by combining benefit and cost view.
  This QUPER model is used to improve the release planning process. So to evaluate the QUPER model the authors interviewed the experts from Sony ericsson and also taken feedback from workshops.
  The evaluation is started after three months of introducing the model in the company. The result indicated that the model is useful in release planning to prioritize the requirements based on quality dimension. The result shows that it is easy to use and improve the communication level among staff.

     
     
   iv. Regnell et al. “A market-driven requirements engineering process: results from an industrial process improvement programme” 
   
   Summary
    
  Requirement engineering process is different for packaged software and bespoke software. In this paper, the authors described a RE process called REPEAT. It is used at Telelogic company for requirement engineering process.
  REPEAT consists of elicitation, validation activities and also selection of requirements and release planning is done. Many actors involve in this process from requirement issuer team to testers.
  It is a repeating process in which a requirement can be changed and added at any time. This process consists of five different phases:
  I. Elicitation phase: In this phase, requirements are collected and classified. Issuer enters the requirements in a web form and submits to RQ database in which the issuer gives priority to the requirements. Human expert revises the requirements and estimates the cost and impact of the requirement.
  Then requirement enters into classified state.
  II. Selection phase: In this phase, a requirements document is prepared which consists of selected list, specification of each requirement and not selected list. Then this document is validated.
  III. Change management, construction, verification and conclusion: After the selection phase, the REPEAT process enters to change management and a new REPEAT process is initiated.
  Then construction phase starts in a iterative manner and verification is done based on requirement document. Then it reaches to conclusion phase in which a review is done and any lessons learned are documented.
  The REPEAT process improvised the release precision in Telelogic company as it consists of effort estimation, prioritization of user requirements, detailed requirement specification, and change management through every phase.
  However, challenges are faced in this process such as connecting fragments and overload control.
  So to overcome these challenges REPEAT-2 is introduced in which it consists of two techniques: Hierarchical use-case modelling which is used to connect requirement fragments and Cost value use case prioritization which is used to sort requirements in efficient way and avoid congestion.

## Questions

1. What tools are available for Continuous Integration?

2. What is technical product management?

3. What is roadmapping? How can you do it large scale?

## Answers

1. There are many tools available for continuous integration. Some of them are listed below:
	i. Jenkins
	ii.Buildbot
	iii. Travis CI
	iv. Strider
	v. Go
	Vi. Integrity
	As these are open source tools. There are many commercial tools which can provide more features.

2. Technical product management is managing the product and involving in technical activities by who knows the technical information. So in case of requirements, the technical understanding of requirements so that discussion with team members will be easy as the manager knows the technical information.
	
3. Roadmapping is a process in which a document is prepared which provides the list of releases of a product over a given time block for future. In large scale the roadmapping need to be done through identifying the future trends  and requirements can be selected by knowing what are present capabilities and which requirements can be put forward for future timeline in roadmap of that product.

## Summary

i. Khurum & Gorschek “A method for early requirements triage and selection utilizing product strategies”

This paper basically explains the selection of requirements from strategic and technical manager combined perspective. A method named MERTS is presented in which it guides to create the product strategies form technical and strategic perspective and from these product strategies the manager can select the right requirements. This method was developed due to lack of methods and companies have limited time so this method can be used to triage, select the requirements. The method usefulness was validated through conducting several practitioner interviews. At first a literature study was done, based on this an initial model with set of five questions are formed and then an industry input is taken through interviews and based on these a final version of model is created as the interviews resulted that the problems found through literature study are correct. There are three steps in the MERTS in which the first step needs to specify the three questions such as where to go, how to get there and what to do. As these questions target the product about the future requirements can be postponed and needed requirement are planned for release.  Then weights need to be assigned for each answer for above questions so a total of 300 will be calculated if each answer is give with maximum value 100.  By comparing the requirements after assigning the weights a threshold can be obtained. So the selection of requirements is done based on the value which is above the threshold. The second step is selection of requirements to release in which a roadmap is set so to vary the requirements for present and future. Also the estimation of   resources, effort required and prioritization is done so to plan the release. The third step is to document the reasons for decision so if it became success it can be repeated through following the documentation. By validating it through the practitioners who are also interviewed at beginning found that method is easy to implement and an abstraction of requirements knowledge is suitable and helpful for both strategic and technical product managers. But the limitation is that the method was only validated with limited number of practitioners so there is a threat of validity so it is limited in scope.
My view: This paper presents a method which is needful for organizations as the strategic and technical product managers can easily discuss the requirements and their selection. But there is need of research to be done to validate it with more number of practitioners. I agree with what is written as the abstraction of requirements make the selection and prioritization of requirements easy and this method gives an easy task to do which leads to selection of requirements. 


ii. Gorschek & Davis “Requirements Engineering. In search of dependent variables”

This paper describes about the framework of dependent variables while accessing the requirements engineering. There are five levels of in which the dependant variables vary. They are requirements phase, project, product, company, society. The dependant variables in requirement phase are effort for requirement analysis, development effort and quality of requirement specification. The dependant variable in project level are cost and time of project and estimated budget, schedule to the actual budget and schedule so meeting it represents the success. Sometimes the requirement change using dependant variables may call success but can be failure in project level. Some requirements change is said to be requirements creep who do not like the overload of requirements, but these are considered by some as good for product as these requirements change may contain quality. The dependant variables in the third level defines the success of product they are requirement selection in which the selected requirements consist less number of errors and increase efficiency and degree of impact in which the product increases the revenue and decrease the cost of development. The dependant variables in fourth level defines success are portfolio management in which products complement with other and resources are utilized in optimized way, strategic alignment means the product aligns with the strategies of corporate or organization, and revenue improvement, profit and return on investment variables are considered for success of company. The dependant variables in fifth level are positive and negative externalities in which the product developed should not harm the environment and should not risk any life so it may consider safety of society if it fails it said to be failure product. So this paper delivers the new knowledge in form of different levels impact of requirements engineering is assessed, and success of product can be considered from the given levels so that success at re specification may be failure at the product level. The goals should be present goals and future goals which should align with the product requirement in future. A roadmap should be considered to know the present requirements and push the limit of the requirement which are necessary for future. 
My view: This paper presents the importance of requirements engineering and their impact on several quality levels. I agree with authors of the paper as their work represents the exact information about how requirements effects the project, product, company and society. So while selecting a requirement one should consider that these are affected by them so selection should be considered from present trends to future trends and changes.

iii.R. Berntsson Svensson, T. Gorschek, B. Regnell, R. Torkar, A.Shahrokni, R. Feldt (2012) “Quality Requirements in Industrial Practice – an extended interview study at eleven companies”, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, vol.38(4), pp. 923-935

This paper focuses on quality requirements as the developing through only functional requirements may lead to customer dissatisfaction and product failure. So one have to consider quality requirements. As many studies are done based on the quality requirements but do not consider the challenges, this paper concentrates on cost estimation challenges in QR and compare two type of companies in analysis they are business to business(B2B) companies and business to consumer(B2C) companies. So a set of research questions are formed based on the experiences of authors and conducted interviews in eleven companies. The most important QR in B2C are usability and in B2B are safety. So basically the investigated questions are most important interdependencies the answer is REQUIRES that is one requirements requires another requirement to function but not vice versa. But it varies between B2B and B2C companies so B2C company views CVALUE as important which one requirements changes the other requirement value for customer. Another research question is how industries carry the elicitation process of interdependencies and the result is that most of the companies do not consider these as these are complex tasks to perform and some companies answered these are assumed and not evaluated. The cost estimation in QR was performed by not having distinct estimated between functional and QR as these are estimated through expert opinion mostly. The result shows that B2B group has more inaccurate estimates than B2C group. Most of the QR are dismissed in some stages of development according to research 41% of QR are dismissed in B2B and 31% are dismissed in B2C. In B2C these are dismissed due to inaccurate estimated and in B2B mostly the QR which are not visible to customers are dismissed and low priority than FR. Consequences for dismissing the QR are done by reconsidering the quality requirements if they are insisted by customer and discuss with developers whether to perform them or not while other project leaders say they can deliver the product fast if they do not consider QR’s. the main things to do is to have a different technique to estimate the quality requirements than same technique which used for FR. Then research is done on specification of QR, results show that not all are quantifiable so some QR are quantified and other such as usability related QR are not quantified. So finally the QR are not considered during the planning stage so there lies the problem to solve the QR also to be elicitated during the early phases only.
My view: This paper discusses the importance of quality requirements for success of software and how industries considering them. The results show that many of the companies do not elicitate the QR during initial stages so there comes the problem. I agree with what the paper says as the most problems of products are due to not considering Quality requirements and only considering the functional requirements, so to be successful and deliver a quality of product it is a good practice to elicitate the quality requirements from initial stages itself.


iv. J. Karlsson, K. Ryan, “A cost-value approach for prioritizing requirements”, IEEE Software, 1997.

Software application development goal is to meet the needs of the stakeholders and developing all requirements from customer is not possible so a subset of requirements need to be selected which meets the needs of customer. In this paper, an analytical tool is developed for prioritizing the requirements using a cost value approach. It is successfully applied in two companies. Process for prioritizing should be simple to use and should be accurate, trustworthy. Also should satisfy the stakeholder satisfaction. This analytical tool considers three factors: quality, time and cost.  The authors investigated the candidate requirements by comparing them with relative cost and time.  The cost-value approach consists of five steps to prioritize the requirements. They are the candidate requirements are carefully observed by requirement engineering to decrease the redundant requirements. Customers and users apply this method to know the value of their requirements through comparison. Experienced software engineers use this method to estimate cost required by a requirement. A software engineer estimate value and cost and plot a relation between cost and value for a requirement. The stakeholder discusses the requirements through using the plot given by software engineers. So finally the discussion result leads to the selection of requirements for development and also for the release planning process. As this method is easy to perform the practitioners really felt useful. But this method is useful for small scale requirements and also consists of many issues to be solved to use in present industries.
My view: this paper discusses the way to prioritize the requirements by analysing them through cost and value. But I do not think it will be helpful in present situation as the scale of requirement using this method is very low and it did not considered interdependencies between the requirements. As present requirements for industries vary from medium scale to large scale requirements such as requirements exceeds 1000 so it will not be helpful.

# Summary

i. Wnuk et al. “What Happened to Our Features? Visualization and Understanding of Scope Change Dynamics in a Large-Scale Industrial Setting”

There is a dynamic change in scope of a product as decisions changed because of circumstance changes. In this paper, the authors presented a technique called feature survival charts which show the features and their respective scope changes by using various colours to identify easily. This technique is evaluated by implementing it in three projects. The practitioners that participated for implementing mainly process manager, requirements manager and key performance indicator manager. The projects are selected based on length, a number of features and possibility to analyse the scope change in the projects. The selected company used milestones and tollgates to monitor project progress by selected experts who are requirements and design teams. This three project differs in their size and complexity as many of projects are in different phases while conducting research. The results showed that for all three projects the scope is not increased as time changes, instead the scope decreased for the features. To track the scope, the time related and feature related measurements are used in which there are subcategories. In time-related the number of positive scope and negative scope changes per given time is measured. While in feature related feature removal time, the number of changes of a feature, time for the new feature to evolve, why a scope is changed are measured. The measurements obtained from time and feature related are analysed by comparing the values with theory and knowledge for this is gained by interacting with requirement managers who are working on projects. After analysing the results for three projects, the comparison is done by using a graphical representation of values. The practitioners identified the use of this technique and mentioned it is valuable for them. As it represents the change in scope easily and tracking can be done in it. It is also useful for further reference in future. As it also increases the understanding of dynamic changes easily. But it is evaluated in only one company, even though it is a large-scale company there needs to be a more analysis in other companies to have a generalized result. The technique can be further improved by having a clarity while zooming and optimizing usability. <br>

My view: The technique developed to easily view the scope changes is useful for companies and I agree with authors to use this technique in companies to easily monitor the changes of scope for their features as these features consist of requirements. For small-scale it does not show that much difference but in large-scale industries this technique will be more useful. The implementation of this technique in companies can be done by standardizing the process and also making it more usable by increasing the usability. <br>

ii. Wnuk & Gorschek “Obsolete Software Requirements” <br>

Requirements which change during development and not needed at all while the project is going on are said to be obsolete requirements. In this paper, the authors conducted a research study because they found that there is little research is done on obsolete requirements such as scope creep, requirement creep. So the main aim of this research is to know what is obsolete requirements, how serious it is considered in industries, are there any category of requirements which said to be more obsolete, are there any methods exist, how they categorize these obsolete requirements with requirements which are actually using, and in which phase these need to be handled. <br>

So authors conducted a survey which is industry based and students are not involved as they do not experience in this and it also conducted in 45 countries. The survey is done to get a generalized view on this topic as there is no particular research is done so qualitative research is not done. The survey results are represented using statistical analysis with the chi-square test. The practitioners mainly said that the requirements which are not useful for present and future release are said to be obsolete requirements and these are considered to be serious by many large scale industries. The requirements which are not clear and which changes frequently have more chances to become obsolete and standards requirements have less chance. There is no particular methods and less number of tools to identify these requirements, the industries mainly use manual identification only. These identified are tagged or labelled as obsolete for future reference mainly. The phases to identify these obsolete requirements are mainly during requirement analysis and validation phases and these are to be updated regularly as there are rapid changes in requirements in market-driven development. <br>

My view: This paper focused on requirements which are not needed and how a company can focus which requirements are useful and which they do not need to be developed by using the past data of projects as these are labelled as obsolete requirements. I agree with authors as they identified new things in which the obsolete requirements need to be identified easily and there have to be a method to do it so companies can easily identify these type of requirements.
