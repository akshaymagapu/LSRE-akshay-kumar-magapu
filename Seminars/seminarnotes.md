## Summary

1. Complexity increases while handling the requirements in very-large scale requirements engineering. The authors identified the key research oppurtunities in this domain. 
   Based on the size of requirements there are four orders of magnitude:In small-scale requirements engineering the order of magnitude is approximately 10 requirements, In medium-scale requirements engineering the order of magnitude is approximately 100 requirements,
   In large-scale requirements engineering the order of magnitude is approximately 1000 requirements and In very large-scale requirements engineering the order of magnitude is approximately 10,000 requirements. So the complexity level is described based on the number of requirements  because these includes the number of customers, end-users, developers, product features.
   Also, complexity depends upon the dependencies between the requirements as in large scale and very large scale requirements engineering the dependencies between requirements are high compared to small and medium-scale requirements engineering. In this paper a case study is done at sony ericsson which had a transition from Large-scale requirements engineering to very large-scale requiremnts engineering.
   As there are many stakeholder internal and external categories, market driven requirements which are originated from external stakeholder are generated by many operators with thousand of requirements.
   So the total number of requirements exceeded more than ten thousand. So to decrease the complexity level of the requirements, the requirements are bundled knto features with samll units and written in natural language with set of properties so to easily allocate in requirement management tool.
   Based on the case study the authors bring forward three key research oppurtunities.
    Sustainable requirements architecture: fighting information overload
   How to manage the information overload while developing and exectuion of previous requirements.
    Efective requirements abstraction: fighting combinatorial explosion
   How to effectively abstract the requirements and combinations of requirements.
    emergent quality prediction: fighting over-scoping.
   How to deal with dependeices among quality requirements and how to predict the effort for large scope of system.
   By knowing these questions managing the complexity of the requirements and predicting system quality aspects can be done.
